# gdanimate-rewrite

WIP rewrite of the [gdanimate](https://github.com/cherrythecool/gdanimate) repo!!! will be merged into the main repo once 1.0 is finished but until then this repo is public for testing, issues, feedback, pull requests, whatever!

## current state

we got most basic stuff working, sparrow atlases work mostly fine (needs a small rework)

adobe atlases (the main feature) are working but while adding mask layer support there's some more bugs i need to fix! so yea

BetterTextureAtlas support will be added after regular animate atlases are finished but are not implemented yet at all
